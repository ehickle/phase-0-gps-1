## Git Reflections

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

* Well, I didn't have a deep understanding of working with a partner on GitHub yet, so this was a very helpful exercise.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

* pulling was more clarified. Also, not pushing to the master branch.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

* I mostly asked questions in regard to pulling. I also accidentally forked the repository off at the beginning of the session, so we learned some bonus material about how to fix that.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

* I'm not really confused about anything, I just need to practice more to get my workflow down to a naturalized state.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

* The first experience was great. Evan was a fantastic partner and Kit was a great guide!
